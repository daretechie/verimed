🚀 I just open-sourced VeriMed - a global medical provider verification API.

It connects to 7 national registries (US, France, UAE, Kenya, Netherlands, Israel, Mexico) + AI document verification.

Built with NestJS. MIT licensed. Zero cost to self-host.

🔗 github.com/daretechie/verimed

### Tweet 2/4
Why I built this:

While working on @LuminaMed (an AI healthcare platform), I realized there's no easy way to verify if a "doctor" is actually licensed.

Every country has different registries, APIs, data formats. It's a nightmare.

VeriMed solves this. 🩺

### Tweet 3/4
Features:
• 7 country adapters (more coming)
• AI document verification fallback
• Fuzzy name matching
• Production-ready (Docker, K8s, health checks)
• Enterprise support available

Perfect for telemedicine, healthtech, and credentialing platforms.

## 📰 Hacker News

**Title:**
Show HN: VeriMed – Open-source API for verifying medical provider licenses globally

**Text:**
Hi HN,

I built VeriMed while working on LuminaMed, an AI-powered telemedicine platform. I quickly realized that verifying whether a healthcare provider is legitimately licensed is surprisingly hard.

Every country has a different registry, different API format (REST, SOAP, FHIR, CKAN), and different access requirements. I couldn't find a unified solution, so I built one.

VeriMed:
- Connects to 7 national medical registries (US NPI, France RPPS, UAE DHA, Kenya KMPDC, Netherlands BIG, Israel MOH, Mexico SEP)
- Falls back to AI document verification when registries aren't available
- Uses fuzzy name matching to handle variations (e.g., "Greg" vs "Gregory")
- Production-ready with Docker, Kubernetes manifests, and health checks
- MIT licensed, free to self-host

Tech stack: NestJS, TypeORM, OpenAI (optional), Fuse.js

GitHub: https://github.com/daretechie/verimed

I'd love feedback on the architecture or suggestions for additional country adapters to prioritize.

## 📎 LinkedIn Post

🚀 Excited to announce the launch of VeriMed - my new open-source project!

While building LuminaMed (an AI-powered telemedicine platform), I discovered a critical gap in healthcare tech: **there's no easy way to verify if a medical provider is legitimately licensed.**

Every country has its own registry. Different APIs. Different data formats. It's fragmented and frustrating.

So I built **VeriMed** - a unified API that connects to **7 national medical registries** across 4 continents:
🇺🇸 USA (NPI)
🇫🇷 France (RPPS)
🇦🇪 UAE (DHA)
🇰🇪 Kenya (KMPDC)
🇳🇱 Netherlands (BIG)
🇮🇱 Israel (MOH)
🇲🇽 Mexico (SEP)

**For countries without live APIs, VeriMed uses AI-powered document verification as a fallback.**

Key features:
✅ Production-ready (Docker, Kubernetes, health checks)
✅ Fuzzy name matching for registry variations
✅ MIT licensed - completely free to self-host
✅ Enterprise support available for teams needing custom integrations

**This is for you if you're building:**
• Telemedicine platforms
• Hospital credentialing systems
• Healthcare marketplaces
• Insurance verification tools

🔗 **Check it out:** https://github.com/daretechie/verimed

I'd love your feedback, stars ⭐, or suggestions for which country registries to add next!
